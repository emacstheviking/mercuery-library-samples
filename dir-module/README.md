# Dir Module

This folder contains working code for the use of some but not all of the
predicates and functions in the Mercury library `dir`.

The main program (sample), when built, allows a single string to be passed and
this is used as input to the filename parsing section if this sample program.

Feel free to extend and raise a PR!
