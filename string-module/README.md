# The String Module

The string library for Mercury is pretty comprehensive and as is usually the
case with Mercury, very well thought out, in fact only after you have
reinvented a wheel or two and then had that "Aha!" moment do you begin to
realise and appreciate the effort that has gone into it.

Again, this is not fully comprehensive of the `string` module but just enough
for me to have learned what I needed to write effective code.


## Building

    $ mmc sample.m


## Running

The single string argument is optional, if not supplied a default is applied,
read the source! The purpose of the string is for it to be used as the subject
of some of the sample calls.

    $ ./sample "A test string of your making"
